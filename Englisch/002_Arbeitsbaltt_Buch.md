### **Step 3: Psychology** 
#### Try to explain waht motivations Benson and Glavez to act the way they do
> Mr. Fred Benson is motivated by his strong craving for authority, which is fed by his wish to have control. On the other hand, Ms. Galvez is driven by her motivation to think for herself and have a mindset of self-dependence.

### **Step 4: Prophecy** 
#### Speculate on the role these two teachers are going to play in the novel.
> Mr. Fred Benson is likely to take on the role of the antagonist, being eager to oppose Marcus whenever he gets the opportunity. If Ms. Galvez has a more significant role than she did in the initial 20 pages, she could potentially assume the role of a mentor.
