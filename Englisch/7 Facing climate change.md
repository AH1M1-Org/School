### Aufgabe d
**Appeal to Emotion:** 
Ardern's use of emotive language creates a strong emotional connection with the audience, making the issues more relatable and urgent. By describing the effects of climate change as "catastrophic" and evoking a "sense of fear," she taps into the audience's emotions, compelling them to empathize with the consequences of climate change. This emotional appeal adds a human element to the speech, enhancing its impact.

**Logical Appeal:** 
Ardern links domestic decisions to global ramifications and illustrates the increasing interdependence of nations. The logical argument emphasizes the urgency of cooperative action and encourages the audience to see the interconnectedness of global issues. By presenting a logical framework, Ardern strengthens her case for collective responsibility, making the speech more convincing and rational.

**Call to Action:**
The rhetorical question, "will you join us?" serves as a direct call to action, urging the audience, particularly global leaders, to actively participate in addressing climate change. It adds a motivational dimension, encouraging individuals to take responsibility for the shared challenges. This call to action transforms the speech from a passive presentation of issues to an active plea for engagement and collaboration.
