###  TASK 1) With a focus on the dystopian elements. Describe the setting of the first chapter: 
The chapter is set in the school and Markus starts to talk about that he is one of the most surveilled people in the world, that means that his school much surveilled for example by the gait recognition software that tracks who leaves or enters the school. Also, the school software for the pc´s tracks the students what they at the computers and how often they click also they were tracked outside the school by school books from the library with an arhip-Radio-Frequency chip that allows to locate the books. Another thing Marcus describe is that they track the students phones. Marcus also describe that he and his classmate have to use military browser to surf safely
### TASK 2) Describe, analyze and contrast the setting of the second and third chapter:
In Chapter 2, the scene switches to the high school grounds we're familiar with. The story has this energetic vibe of adventure and friendship as Marcus and his pals go around the school. They pick the teacher's lounge as their secret place to plan stuff, like when they decide to microwave the arphid – that's pretty bold! The mood is light and excited as they put their plan in motion. This part shows how they're in control and smartly using phones and Wi-Fi for their unique idea.

But then, Chapter 3 takes a big turn. They're not at school anymore. It's like a whole new world of chaos and not knowing what's up. The busy BART station goes wild as something bad goes down and people react. This chaos outside is totally different from the calm teacher's lounge. And then the story gets really intense. Marcus and friends end up in this big truck with no labels, turned into some sort of command center. Inside the truck, the vibe is all serious and tense – now armed folks are calling the shots.
