#### Concept
1. **Geothermal Power Stations Overview:**
    - Extraction of hot water from deep underground.
    - Utilisation of resulting vapour to drive a turbine.
2. **Electricity Generation Process:**
    - Turbine-driven by vapor converts mechanical energy into electricity.
    - Electricity produced as a result of the turbine's rotation.
3. **Recirculation and Cooling System:**
    - Cooled water from the turbine is pumped back.
    - Water is reheated for another cycle.
4. **Continuous Cycle:**
    - Establishment of a sustainable cycle for energy production.
    - Circulation process ensures efficiency and long-term functionality.
#### Types
- The oldest type is [dry steam](https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/electricity-generation "Dry Steam Plants") = which takes steam directly from fractures in the ground to drive a turbine.
- [Flash plants](https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/electricity-generation "Flash Plants") = pull high pressure hot water from underground and mix it with cooler low pressure water. This, in turn, creates steam that is used to drive a turbine.
- [Binary plants](https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/electricity-generation "Binary Plants") = use hot water passed through a secondary fluid that has a lower boiling point than water. The secondary fluid is turned into vapour which drives a turbine. Most future geothermal power plants are expected to be binary plants.

#### Usages
- **Electricity Generation:** Geothermal power plants convert the Earth's heat into electricity. Steam or hot water from the geothermal reservoir is used to turn turbines
- **Geothermal Heat Pumps (Heating):** Geothermal heat pumps use the Earth's stable temperature to heat buildings during cold periods. They extract heat from the ground and transfer it indoors.
- **Geothermal Heat Pumps (Cooling):** In warmer weather, geothermal heat pumps can reverse their operation, extracting heat from buildings and transferring it into the cooler ground, providing efficient cooling.
#### Advantages
- Environment friendly =  produces just one-sixth of the carbon dioxide emitted by a clean natural-gas power plant.
- Cheaper than = conventional energy, with savings of as much as 80% compared with fossil fuels.
- constantly available = Unlike other renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, it is constantly available.
#### Disadvantages
- Production is limited to areas = near tectonic plate boundaries. In addition, some locations may cool down after decades of use.
- Sulphide can be released = a gas that smells like rotten eggs. Finally, some geothermal fluids contain low levels of toxic materials which need to be disposed of.
- Drilling = Although it is cheaper than fossil fuels once a plant has been built, the drilling and exploration of these sites is expensive. This is in part due to the amount of wear experienced by drills and other tools in such aggressive environments.
