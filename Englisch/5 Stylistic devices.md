On page 66 the author uses italics. “I have no idea what you are talking about”. The repetition of this phase and the use of italics could mean that the author wants to emphasize the fact that Marcus is overwhelmed by his feelings and feeling very desperate. 

On page 73 the is another comparison: “My memories swam like …” 

The overly excessive use of comparisons leads to the fact that the reader gets an insight to the protagonist’s emotions. This paints a vivid picture of the situation and underlines that Marcus really is involved emotionally in the whole situation.

There is an enumeration on page 42 in lines one to three. “ … -an ambulance - didn’t even slow down. Neither did the cop car …nor the fire truck …”

There is a rhetorical question/ irony on page 99 in line 30. “What if I got hit by lightning …”
The author wants to show how ridiculous the situation is, as if anybody would hide a bomb. It underlines the fact that Marcus is angry about the fact that they have banned his most favorite game and again restricted his privacy. 

There is an ellipsis on page 87 in line two to four. “… they were watching me. Surveilling me. …” 
The author wants to convey the feeling of being watched constantly and this adds a dramatic effect to the scene. 


There is an exaggeration/ hyperbole on page 45 in lines 7 to 10. “My body had …” 
This choice of words underlines the inhumane strength a person can get from an adrenaline rush and depicts Marcus’s reaction to the situation of being scared/being captured and trapped in a cell.
