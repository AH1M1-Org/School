### Speech 


We depend on fossil fuels and other countries! Germany produces energy with natural gas and brown coal, its 30% from Germanys consumption, the other 70% are imported from other countries. Germany have less resources too produce energy with fossil fuels so we need to import uranium, oil and other stuff from other countries. When you think you don't have too worry about you are false! Too power your PC you damage the environment and you increase the damage of climate Change!  

We germans need more independence from others and more energy production of our own, more environment friendly energy! So what can our country do? Its a simpel answer for a complicate question, produce energy with renewable energy. So we germans would be more environment friendly and have more money to spend for schools and education. Also german technology can be sold to help against the climate change and help our neighbours to life a green energy way. Our country have the chance to produce 100% green energy for example biogas, solar and wind energy.

Lets look at the other side of the world to get some ideas how can it works! South Korea have 15% energy production of his own and want to extend to 40% production in year 2034.
