**What do you have to keep in mind if you want to write a speech?**

- Introduction —> address the audience
- Focus on your targetgroup
- Talk to the audience (directly to them)
- Use emotions and “play” in the audience’s emotions
- Confident speech (use examples, or quotes from experts/scientists, numbers,…) 
- Use stylistic devices (repetition, pronouns,…)
